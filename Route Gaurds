--->Angular provides lots of features and ready-to-use services which allow seamless development of web applicationAnd protecting routes with 
Guards are one of the important and useful feature.
--> we can navigate to any route but sometimes you need to control access to different parts of your app.

-->Guards in angular are  interfaces which can tell the router whether or not it should allow navigation to a requested route.
--> So If all guards return true, navigation will continue. If any guard returns false, navigation will be cancelled.
-->Guards return either true if the user can access a route or false if they canâ€™t.


There are five different types of Guards:

CanActivate
Checks to see if a user can visit a route.

CanActivateChild
Checks to see if a user can visit a routes children.

CanDeactivate
Checks to see if a user can exit a route.

Resolve
Performs route data retrieval before route activation.

==>CanActivate Route
This class implements the CanActivate interface by implementing the canActivate function.
When canActivate returns true, the user can activate the route. When canActivate returns false, the user cannot access the route. 
In the above example, we allow access when the user is logged in.
canActivate can also be used to notify the user that they can't access that part of the application, or redirect them to the login page.
