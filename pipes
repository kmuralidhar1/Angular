==>pipes:A pipe is a class decorated with pipe metadata.
Angular has different types of pipes such as DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, LowerCasePipe, CurrencyPipe, and PercentPipe. They are all available for use in any template.
command: '|'


pipes are classified as:

                                     ___   Parametrized pipes
Custom pipes  &   Build in Pipes==>|
                                     ___   Chaining pipes
                          
a)built in pipes:- pipes such as DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, LowerCasePipe, CurrencyPipe, and PercentPipe. They are all available for use in any template.
Angular provides several built-in pipes to beautify the data being shown on the user interface.  
e.g.,to generate the pipes thw syntax: ng g p {pipes name}

In Pipes.component.html, we’ve interpolated the properties and used pipes to format them.
b)parameterized pipes:- 
when we pass any parameters to the pipes, it is called parameterized pipes we can pass n number of parameters to pipes using a colon (:).
syntax:- <property-name> | pipe-name
medium Time : {{today | date:mediumTime}}
“date” is a simple non-parameterized pipe that is used to convert the current date in the MMM dd, yyyy format.
C)chaining pipes:-
You can chain pipes together in potentially useful combinations. In the following example, to display the birthday in uppercase, 
the birthday is chained to the DatePipe and on to the UpperCasePipe. The birthday displays as APR 15, 1988.

syntax:The chained hero's birthday is
{{ birthday | date | uppercase}}

d) Custom pipe:- 
we can write our own custom pipes. Here's a custom pipe named ExponentialStrengthPipe that can boost a hero's powers.
syntax:-ng generate <pipe_name>
